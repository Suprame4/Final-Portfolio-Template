When first learning react one of the very first full-stack projects I built was this app, and ever since I've continued to add new features and functionality. While this app is very simple it has allowed me to learn some many interesting things in programming and web development.

## Competencies
### JF 1.7 Follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control

My company and team uses a wide variety of tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment/delivery, most notably: Github, GHAs, Jenkins, Docker, Spinnaker, and AWS. Due to scope and cost I was only able to use a handful of tools in this project, but plan to continue integrating more GHA workflows for testing and deployment/delivery. 

My current deployment utilizes the following technologies/tools for CI/CD: Github, GHAs and Renderjs. With every commit made to my backend repo, Renderjs automatically redeploy's the app with no manual intervention involved. Current and future GHA workflows will be updated to build and test my app with each commit and PR.


### JF 4.5 Software testing frameworks and methodologies

For this project I used a wide variety of tools and technologies for testing my full-stack app, beginning with simple unit testing of react components to more complex integration and end-to-end testing. 

My current testing experiences with my team have mostly been manual and unit testing of the frontend. By working on this app it has developed my understanding of different tools and technologies used in react and web development, allowing me to bring a new persepctive to my team.
